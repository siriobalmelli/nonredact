# The CompSci Guide to Complication

Some astronomically high percentage of work in Tech is time spent understanding
	(and sometimes avoiding breakage caused by) other people's complications.

Not all complications are malicious - some are just plain stupid, or necessary
	because of stupidity elsewhere!

Here is a handy (humorously intended) guide to complication:

| if you complicate to ...                 | you might be ...        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| lock in profits                          | [Microsoft][1]          |
| sell hardware                            | [Cisco][2]              |
| avoid actually understanding the problem | [L. User][3]            |
| behave sanely, even on insane hardware   | [Paul Mc. Kenney][4]    |
| save the world from impurity             | [Eelco Dolstra][5]      |
| get around massive CPU bugs              | [Linus Torvalds][6]     |
| look smart and get funding               | [the IPv6 committee][7] |
| illegally intercept communications       | [the NSA][8]

## The Cure - simplicity

1. Max Kanat-Alexander's book [Code Simplicity][11]

1. [Linus Torvalds on Simplicity][12]

1. [Quotations on simplicity in software design][13]

1. [this][14] fascinating reddit thread

1. The authoritative dissertation on [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way][15]

## Philosophical Note

Simplicity is reached by finding common denominators
(one example which springs to mind is UNIX's "everything is a file" approach).

Common denominators are tested by asking *why?* and *how is this useful?*
(example: what problems does the "everything is a file" approach solve?).

## Motivation

This may come across as a bit snarky - I've had a long day getting
	[redacted] to work and all the needless complexity inspired this rant.

Here's to simpler software in our future.
Happy hacking.
