# nonRedact

This blog began with an idea of doing companion YouTube screencasts,
but for one reason or another the video thing had bugs and I kept writing.

The purpose is mostly to
~publicly declare ideas for which I will be ridiculed in the future~
host those rants or notes which I may want to refer back to in the future.

Everything in this repo is free for you to use should you find it helpful;
though it is given without any warranty whatsoever.

In return, I beg you please overlook any bad puns, overly opinionated statements,
cancerous code, swearwords, kittens or whatever it is offends you;
forgiveness is divine.

Anything I say does not represent anyone else or any other organization I
may be otherwise connected to in any way.

Should anything you find here be helpful or make you laugh,
I do of course enjoy public praise and attribution ;)
