# nonRedact

The companion blog to [What We Actually Do](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHY_xC1JcrRsHnYPONdQrDhNJ9E2OTDVa)
	on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9MXuceCBZ4xZnIJLywstQ).

This is what Anthony and I hope will be a regular series of videos,
	wherein we detail "what programmers really do";
	live, unscripted, unedited, un-(gulp)-censored.

Episodes are never edited or overdubbed in post;
	what happened is what you see.

We're putting this together mostly so we can:
	- answer the question *"yeah, but what do you actually DO?"*
	- inject a bit of humor into our work
	- document some of the Open Source work we're doing
	- have a reason to talk nonsense while drinking coffee

You guess which one is most important ;)

Everything in this repo is free for you to use should you find it helpful;
	though it is given without any warranty whatsoever.

In return, we beg you please forgive any bad puns, overly opinionated statements,
	cancerous code, swearwords, kittens or whatever it is offends you;
	forgiveness is divine.

Keep in mind that my opinions are not Tony's opinions (and vice versa!)
	and that what we say does not represent anyone else
	or any other organization we may be otherwise connected to in some way.

Should anything you find here be helpful or make you laugh,
	we do of course enjoy public praise and attribution ;)
