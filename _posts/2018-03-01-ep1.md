# Episode 1: "not a git"

Anthony and I kick off what we hope will be a regular series of videos,
	wherein we detail "what programmers really do";
	live, unscripted, unedited, un-(gulp)-censored.

This is the [YouTube episode](https://youtu.be/WwjgixrNrjo)

In this episode:

1. The audio/video setup for our podcast:
	- iTunes, Anthony over Skype and myself on the local mic and webcam
	- [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools)
	- [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower)
	- [Vidrio](https://vidr.io/)

1. Some general humor and memes, and tech mentions, including:
	- [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)

1. An in-depth rundown of [notagit](https://siriobalmelli.github.io/notagit/),
		our open-source utility for managing secure private Git servers,
		and how to build the "poor man's Git cluster".
	- Working with Git from BASH on both Linux and macOS (OS X)
	- How to access Git repos over SSH from a Windows machine,
		(and a lot of time spent waiting for Windows to install things,
		during which we indulge in some obligatory Redmond-bashing).

Along the way, we:

- Use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and show off Microsoft's pre-built
	[Windows 10 development appliances](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines)

- Install [Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/) on Windows.

- Mention [Google's FileStream](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7491144?hl=en)
	and what it's FAT32 representation (FUSE? just a guess)
	does to home-grown small-business apps from the 90s :P

- Use [Pastebin](https://www.paste.org/p/home) with [wget](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget)

- Unscrupolously edit [/etc/sudoers](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sudoers)

- Set up a [crontab file](http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference)

In the background we play:

- [Circus Maximus' Nine album](http://www.circusmaximussite.com/release/nine/)
- [Coldplay's Ghost Stories](http://coldplay.com/recordings/ghost_stories/)
- [Daft Punk's Random Access Memories](http://www.randomaccessmemories.com/)

These all belong to their respective authors and we thank them profusely
	for making good art for the world to enjoy and for us to buy.
Please don't sue me ;)

Also, we use swearwords.
They are not meant offensively in any case - despite the fact that we (mostly I)
	can be quite opinionated.
Forgiveness is divine; we beg yours and hope any glaring insanities
	only serve to make you shake your head and laugh ;)
